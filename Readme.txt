InformSideKick was developed with IntelliJ IDEA, which is what the InformSideKick.i?? files concern.  Unit tests are included, which is what testParserData.txt concerns, but the only way they are set up to run is through IDEA.

Building InformSideKick:
Ensure that ErrorList.jar and SideKick.jar are on the classpath.  Set the destination dir in build.properties if you wish, then run "ant" or "ant dist" to create the jar.
